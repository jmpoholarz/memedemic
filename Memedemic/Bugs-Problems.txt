Memedemic Current Bug List
1. Should change function signatures of GSM to ints instead of bool to better handle error checking
2. gsm.buildCMCServer() asks for a location, but the parser doesn't have that information
	- based on the current user's turn which the GSM should have already
3. gsm.banMeme() takes a location but only needs the number of the meme; location would be the
	the current player's location
4. shareCard does not take reasonable arguments
	- parser has which card and to which player name to be transferred
5. developMemeFilter() does not take data available to the filter it its arguments
